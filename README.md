# Conway's Game of Life
## includes variable rule set
- Conway's original requires 2 or 3 neighbors to stay alive
- and exactlly 3 neighbors for a dead cell to be 'born'
- In my version you can adjust the range of required neighbors to remain alive
- and set the specific number of neighbors (1 - 8) for a dead cell to be born
## requires SDl2 libray installed

This is currently a work in progress,
