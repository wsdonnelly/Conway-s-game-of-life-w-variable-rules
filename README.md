# Conway's Game of Life
## includes variable rule set
- original game requires 2 or 3 neighbors to stay alive
- exactlly 3 neighbors for a dead cell to be born
- in my version you can adjust the range of required neighbors to remain alive
- set the specific number of neighbors (1 - 8) for a dead cell to be born
## requires SDl2 libray installed

Readme and program is a work in progress.......
